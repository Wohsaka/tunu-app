Repository for Tunu app, a recipes of food app I made with Expo React Native, React Native Paper and Edaman's recipes API.

Its an app that let your search recipes of food with a searchbar or you can explore the categories by dish type, meal type and cuisine type.
Once yo found a recipe that interest you, touching it will open a modal with all the details of this recipe includin: Ingredients, number of servings cuisine type,
dish type, healt labels, diet labels, cautions and a link to the source page where you can get the instructions for making this recipe.

Also you can share the source link of the recipe or add it to your favorites with the buttons at the top of the modal, The app counts with dark mode support too.
